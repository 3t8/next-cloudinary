# Getting Started with CldOgImage

## Basic Usage

The basic required prop is `src`:

```
<CldOgImage
  src="images/turtle"
/>
```

But you can use any of the available features from [CldImage](/components/cldimage/configuration) to build your CldOgImage.

You can further take advantage of Cloudinary features like background removal and overlays by adding additional props:

```
<CldOgImage
  src="images/turtle"
  tint="100:0000FF:0p:FF1493:100p"
  blur="2000"
  backgroundRemoval
  overlays={[{
    text: {
      color: 'white',
      fontFamily: 'Source Sans Pro',
      fontSize: 200,
      fontWeight: 'bold',
      text: 'Next Cloudinary'
    }
  }]}
  underlays={[{
    publicId: 'images/galaxy',
    width: 1920,
    height: 1200,
    crop: 'fill'
  }]}
  alt="Next Cloudinary over picture of a turtle on top of a galaxy"
  twitterTitle="Next Cloudinary"
/>
```
